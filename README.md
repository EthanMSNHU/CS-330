How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    During this course using opegl it gave me a lot of practice using an API within my code which before this course I had little to no practice using. 
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    The way I went about designing my projects in the course is I would code according to the assignment I was doing, check for errors, solve errors then try and run the code again. For the most part up until module 6 I Believe it worked very well for me. Then it got to       the point where the errors were never ending. I did not know where to start debugging. 
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    I think it can be applied to a lot of things, such as completing the task, checking your work after completion, making changes and or fixing said task you completed then being done. 
How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Like I said before I would develop all of the code then try and run the application and then debug if I need to afterwards. Looking back because there is so much going on using opengl. Moving forward I am going to start coding in small bits testing, debugging then         moving forward so i can isolate the errors earlier on rather than at the end of a triple digit line project. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
    It made it easier when having bits of code that are almost the same.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  My approach to developing code stayed the same throughout this course and the milestones, like i said above, moving forward I am going to not do the entire project at once then debug I am going to code in sections that make sense to better evaluate my code. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    This gave me perspective into software development especially in the video game design side of Computer Science. It showed me how much work it really is and that if I want to do it I need to be more committed to my work. 
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    It gave me perspective that if I want to pursue a career in this field I need to pay attention to my development cycle and how I code my actual work. It showed me that sometimes it might be better in larger and more complex projects both in the realm of code and in        real life to take things slow and do things in sections to maximize success and efficiency,
